# Contributing

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs/Features, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints (currently broken..., but follow style from other existing code).
6. Issue that pull request!

## Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/tjmoses/selection-drag/issues); it's that easy!

## Write detailed Bug Reports/Issues

[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report, and I think it's not a bad model. Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408), a solid app developer.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. [Prior stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code that *anyone* with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

I'm again borrowing these from [Facebook's Guidelines](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/blob/a9316a723f9e918afde44dea68b5f9f39b7d9b00/CONTRIBUTING.md)

- 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
- You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification (curretnly broken, so scratch this...)
- Follow the existing code style at all costs (if there are issues bring them up with an issue).
